Made by Simon Kamuk Christiansen and Matias Bundgaard-Nielsen

This repository contains demo code showcasing our simulations using the Faster Amplitude Estimation algorithm to estimate inner products of two 1-qubit and two 4-qubit quantum vectors. The inner products are used for training a Quantum Neural Network for classifying 4x4 downsampled mnist images. Furthermore, we also showcase how the inner product estimation algorithm was implemented on real quantum hardware using Microsoft Azure. 

The work in this repository is based on work from our 5-ECTS special course at DTU during our Master's education.
